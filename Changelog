## [1.0.0] - 2017-06-20

### Changed

- Change date to ISO 8601 format 
- The longitude was recorded as positive values, however, after QC and cross-reference to other data recorded during the same cruise, it is clear that the values should be negative.
- Re-write column names for clarity: "new" = 'old'

    "rinko_sea_water_temperature" = `TEM_R`,
