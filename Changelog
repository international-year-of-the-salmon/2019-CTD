## [1.0.0] - 2022-07-27

### Changed

- Change date to ISO 8601 format 
- The longitude was recorded as positive values, however, after QC and cross-reference to other data recorded during the same cruise, it is clear that the values should be negative.
- Re-write column names for clarity: "new" = 'old'
       "sea_water_temperature" = `TEM_S`,
    "sea_water__salinity" = `SAL_S`,
    "sea_water_conductivity" = `Cond. [mS/cm]_R`,
    "sea_water_EC25" = `EC25 [uS/cm]_R`,
    "sea_water_density" = `Density [kg/m^3]_R`,
    "sea_water_sigma_t" = `SigmaT [ ]_R`,
    "sea_water_turbidity" = `Turb-M [FTU]_R`,
    "sea_water_chlorophyll_fluorescence" = `Chl-Flu. [ppb]_R`,
    "sea_water_chlorophyll_a_concentration" = `Chl-a [ug/l]_R`,
    "sea_water_dissolved_oxygen" = `DO [mg/l]_R`,
    "sea_water_dissolved_oxygen_saturation" = `DO [%]_R`,
    "sea_water_concentration_of_oxygen" = `O2 [ml/l]`,
    "sea_water_pH" = pH,
    "BOD5" = `BOD5[ml/l]`
